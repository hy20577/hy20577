# About

As a data enthusiast with a robust academic background and hands-on experience in applied mathematics and data analytics, I thrive on solving complex problems using machine learning algorithms and quantitative methods. My PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Essex, combined with my MSc in Statistics with Data Analytics from Brunel University London, has equipped me with a deep understanding of data visualisation, programming, and statistical analysis. I've had the privilege of teaching and mentoring students, leading lab classes, and problem-solving sessions in data visualisation and text analytics with R. My research endeavours have further honed my skills, particularly in network inference and connectivity using statistical approaches. I'm passionate about leveraging my expertise to uncover insights from data and develop innovative solutions. Proficient in Matlab, R, and Python, I am always eager to explore new challenges in the realm of data science and machine learning.

## Education

## Experience

* Assistant Lecturer, University of Essex, Colchester, UK (October 2021 - April 2024)

I have been leading lab classes and problem-solving sessions of up to 60 students in
the modules of Data Visualisation (MA304), Programming and Text Analytics with R
(MA331), Applied Regression and experimental data analysis (MA717).

* Research Assistant, University of Essex, Colchester, UK (Summer, 2022 & 2023) 

I worked as a data analyst in an ongoing project of mathematics education at the
University of Essex, in the summer terms of 2022 and 2023 and developed shinny R
interactive app to present the findings of my statistical analysis.

* Math Teacher Fen Bilimleri Private College, Istanbul, Turkiye (August 2015 - June 2018)

I had been instructing classes of up to 20 students, aged 16-18, in a wide range of
mathematics subjects, including A Level topics.
